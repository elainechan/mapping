# Untitled Mapping Project
## Features
* Bike parking
* Bike routes
* Neighborhood boundaries
---
## Transit Information

---
## Hyperlocal Information
### News
* 'How sick is New York right now?' 
	- For a given geograpic area, at what rate are people tweeting symptoms and diseases ('cough', 'flu', 'sneeze', 'fever', 'allergy', etc.)?
* News tracking: correctly detect topic + sentiment from a block of tweets.
	- Can we predict flu epidemic in X city? (search by geolocation)
	- Is there a current housing crisis in San Francisco, comparing yoy? (search by geo and time)
		* Time series analysis
			* Severity y-o-y, m-o-m ('20% increase over last month')
			* Volume of tweets y-o-y, m-o-m
			* number of evictions y-o-y, m-o-m
		* Sentiment analysis (varies based on search: 'homeless', 'evicted' are definitely negative)
		* Last step: monthly tweet sent out saying 'evictions appear to be up in San Francisco'
		* (Later version: to work around rate limits, use seperate Twitter accounts/Oauth credentials for individual major cities)
#### Method: Source Tweets
* Using geolocation information (latlongs, neighborhoods, streets, landmarks, buildings, etc.), retrieve tweets using Twitter API.
* Provide input field for keyword queries.
* Display relevant tweets on page.
* Possible focus on tweets by neighborhood bloggers.
### Activity information
* Eat, drink - restaurants, cafes, bars
* Work, study - offices, schools, libraries, coworking spaces, cafes with wifi
* Play - bowling allies, parks, cinemas, theaters, concert venues, performance spaces, museums
#### Method: Source FourSquare Data
* Using geo information, retrieve nearby venues
* Provide menu for category (eat, drink, work, study, play), and input field for keyword queries.

## Consuming Twitter and FourSquare APIs for Location Information
[Blog Post on Twitter GET](http://elainechan.nyc/twitter-api/)
### Collecting Twitter Data
* Write to file with .get tweets passing params
* Refine search to make sure we're getting 'valid' tweets
* Parse those results for data
* Within this time range, in this geo location, matching this query, how many tweets are there?
#### Tweepy Streaming Steps
1. Authenticate using four tokens.
2. Create a live streaming listener.
3. Save data in two formats simultaneously:
	a. Use `data` parameter and save as `JSON`.
	b. Use `status` parameter and save as `txt`.
#### Node Twitter

## Secondary Features
### Trendline Analysis (not)
* Static interactive visualization of a dataset
* Use D3 to present the trend line
	- Hover over trendline: display a single tweet that represents the trend and hyperlink to view original tweet on Twitter
* If scanning historical and current tweets for trends in a city, could present trend data periodically (using Heroku scheduler, 'run once a day')
* API calls will come from frontend JavaScript
	1. Python script writes out some JSON with the 'analysis results'
	2. That JSON is dropped into the top of your `app.js` file
	3. The same `app.js` file makes API calls to D3, maybe to embed some tweets
* "Datastore" is just `var Store = {}`
* Use heroku to serve `index.html`, `index.css` and `app.js` files
* Once the first Node/Express app is 'up' on Heroku, you can put files in the `/public` folder and they'll be served verbatim with no extra logic required

## Notes
page=1
result=[]
page=100
if (result.length = 0)
{request with page= 50}
{request page=25}
the service knows it has 100 results:
impossible: (you ask for page 1, 50 results per page, it gives you a full array)

"take a look at some example tweets"
sentiment analysis week by week

curl https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?

q='to%3ANASA&tweet_mode=extended'

Twitter search API
15 requests in 15 minutes
setTimeout() to space out requests
have dataset by Tuesday

// Take 200s break in setTimeout
```javascript
function getCityData(){
    //request data cities[currentCityIndex]
    //log out the result
    currentCityIndex ++;
    setTimeout(getCityData, 100000)
}
getCityData();
```

when you are getting errors for a deep object reference

continue to test that each stage is there
the array of results has a nonzero lenfgth *the first exists, && second exists etc
try { setting this variable } catch {} - does not stop execution
try{setting this variable} catch {console.log('error on line 51') }
